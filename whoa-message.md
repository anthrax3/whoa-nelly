Hey there.

Someone just typed a command to yank you from that conversation. We've pulled you from the channels you were in for a bit. Think of it as a 'whoa there'.

You probably did or said something that's against our Code of Conduct. Take a moment and read it. This is probably not a big deal, but _this is important_. We're stopping here so it doesn't become a big deal.

The Code of Conduct is at http://lgbtq.technology/coc.html. Please do give it a read.

In particular, watch out for something you said that may have been racist, sexist, or transphobic.

Admins have been notified, and they will explain the details of what happened and hopefully set things straight. Please refrain from rejoining channels until they have had a chance to talk to you.
